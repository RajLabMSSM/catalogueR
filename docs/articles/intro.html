<p><em>eQTL Catalogue</em> includes a large number of standardized QTL datasets (110 datasets from 20 studies as of 7/4/2020). It actually contains more than just eQTL data. For each dataset, the following kinds of QTLs can be queried:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>gene expression QTL</strong>: <code>quant_method="ge"</code> (<em>default</em>) or <code>quant_method="microarray"</code>, depending on the dataset. catalogueR will automatically select whichever option is available.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>exon expression QTL</strong>: <em>under construction</em> <code>quant_method="ge"</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>transcript usage QTL</strong> <em>under construction</em> <code>quant_method="tx"</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>promoter, splice junction and 3สน end usage QTL</strong> <em>under construction</em> <code>quant_method="txrev"</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view of a metadata table for all current datasets:</p>
