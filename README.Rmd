Rapid querying, colocalization, and plotting of summary stats from the
[*eQTL Catalogue*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/). 

*eQTL Catalogue* currently contains 110 QTL datasets 
(full, genome-wide, standardized summary statistics and metadata) 
from 20 different studies (including GTEx V8), 
across many tissues/cell types/conditions (*updated: 7/5/20*).  

## Intro  

The functions in `catalogueR` are partly derived from the 
[*eQTL Catalogue* tutorial](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/eQTL-Catalogue-resources/blob/master/scripts/eQTL_API_usecase.html).  
Additional *eQTL Catalogue* resources:  
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/eQTL-Catalogue-resources)  
- [In-depth API documentation](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/api-docs/)  
- [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.924266v1)  
- FTP server: *ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/spot/eQTL/csv*

*NOTE*: [The ALT allele is always the effect allele in eQTL Catalogue](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/Data_access/).

## Installation 

### [1] *Optional step: conda*   

To ensure all dependencies are installed and don't conflict with each other, 
you can create a *conda* environment by downloading [this *yaml* file](https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/catalogueR/blob/master/inst/conda/catalogueR.yml) and 
entering the following in command line:  
```
conda env create -n <path_to_yml>/catalogueR.yml
```

### [2] Install `catalogueR` in R  

#### Tabix 

If you don't use the *conda* env, you will also need to make sure [tabix](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) is installed.

**NOTE**: Different distributions of *tabix* may work with 
varying degrees of consistency. 
I recommend you try them in the following order of preference:

1. [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/htslib) (for Mac users).
2. [source](http://www.htslib.org/download/) 
3. [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/tabix) 
  - As of Feb 2021, I noticed that the bioconda distribution of *tabix* 
  will randomly fail at queries. It appears this hasn't been updated 
  in over 2 years, so I do NOT recommend you use it.
  

```R
if(!"remotes" %in% installed.packages()){install.packages("remotes")}
remotes::install_github("RajLabMSSM/catalogueR")
```
